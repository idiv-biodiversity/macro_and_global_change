# Distribution data and IUCN assessments

Date & time: Tuesday, June 9^th, 10:15 -- 17:15 

Teachers: Alexander Zizka, German Center for Integrative Biodiversity research

## Before the practical

- Please install R (>=3.5) and RStudio on your computer

- Run the installation script available [here](https://idiv-biodiversity.github.io/macro_and_global_change/01_setup.html) (by simply copying it into your R console) 

- Have a look at the course literature listed below if you are interested

## Objectives
After this practical you will be able to:

1. Obtain large scale species occurrence records from www.gbif.org databases in R 

2. Perform basic filters for geographic data quality in R

3. Run simple biogeographic and automated conservation assessment analyses

# Schedule
10:15 - 11:30 Biodiversity databases - Intro and exploration

11:30 - 12:15 Code and Software demonstration

13:15 - 17:15 Self study using on-line material, tutoring via Slack

## Background
The public availability of large-scale species distribution data has increased drastically over the last ten years. In particular, due to the aggregation of records from museums and herbaria, and citizen science in public databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). This is leading to a ‘big data’ revolution in macroevolution and macroecology, which holds an enormous but still poorly explored potential for understanding large scale patterns and drivers of biodiversity in space and time.

## Assignment
At the end of the first three exercise, you will find some questions for self assessment and to make sure to progress during the practical. Please create a folder with your name at "Block course/Tutorials_week1/Day2_Distribution_data_and_IUCN_assessments/examination" and put a text file with your answers in it. Please also copy the output files from the afternoon exercises (those that you write to the disk) to this folder.
